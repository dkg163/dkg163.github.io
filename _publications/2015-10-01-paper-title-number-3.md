excerpt: 'Artificial Intelligence (AI) Ethics is a nascent yet critical research field. Recent developments in generative AI and foundational models necessitate a renewed look at the problem of AI Ethics. In this study, we perform a bibliometric analysis of AI Ethics literature for the last 20 years based on keyword search. Our study reveals a three-phase development in AI Ethics, namely an incubation phase, making AI human-like machines phase, and making AI human-centric machines phase. We conjecture that the next phase of AI ethics is likely to focus on making AI more machine-like as AI matches or surpasses humans intellectually, a term we coin as “machine-like human”.'
